    * Components of a computer
    * 
    * Which part of the computer coordinates all computer operations 
    * and performs arithmetic and logical operations on data? 
    * 
        * The CPU
    * 
    * Which part stores data and results?
    * 
        * The main meory
    * 
    * What are the two types of main memory most computers have? 
    * 
        * Read-only memory (ROM) and volatile memrory 
    * 
    * What are registers and where are they located in a computer?
    * 
        * High-speed memory location inside the CPU.
    *
    * List examples of input devices and output devices
    *
        * Input:  Keyboard Mouse
        * output: Speaker, Printer, Monitor
    *
    * What is auxillary memory
    *  
        * More or less permanent memory.
    *
    * Who developed the C language and what are some of its advantages?
    *
        * Dennis Ritchie; Advantages: fast, efficient, portable, power and flexibility
    *
    * What is a preprocessor directive?
    *
        * Commands that begin with the symbol #
        * A preprocessor modifies a C program by possible actions like:
        * – Inclusion of other files
        * – Definition of constant macros
    * 
    * What are the two parts of a function body?
    *
        * Variable Declarations
        * Executable statements
    * 
    * In which function does program execution begin?
    * 
        * Main function
    * 
    * What is the difference between a standard identifier and a reserved word?
    * 
        * Standard Identifier - A word having special meaning but one that a programmer may redefine.
        * Ex. (printf, scanf)
        * Reserved Word - A word that has a special meaning in C. Cannot be used for other purposes
        * Ex. (int, main, void) 
    * 
    * List the syntax rules for valid identifiers and examples of valid vs. invalid identifiers
    * 
        * 1. An identifier must consist only of letters, digits and underscores.
        * 2. An identifier cannot begin with a digit.
        * 3. A C reserved word cannot be used as an identifier
        * 4. An identifier defined in a C standard library should not be redefined.
        * Valid     - testingThis
        * Invalid   - 1Letter
